# Analyzing Employee Mental Health and Remote Work Impact
## This project explores the relationship between remote work factors and employee mental health using a dataset of 5,000 employees. It includes statistical analyses such as ANOVA, Chi-Square tests, correlation, and multiple regression to understand how variables like work-life balance, stress levels, company support, and productivity changes interact. The findings help identify key workplace factors that influence mental well-being, providing insights for better remote work policies and mental health support.
